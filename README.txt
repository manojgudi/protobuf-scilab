Overview
========

This package provides a Matlab code generator for version 2.4.1 of Google's
Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc) as well as support libraries for the
generated Matlab code.


Building protoc with Matlab support
===================================

1. Get the protobuf source:
   svn co http://protobuf.googlecode.com/svn/tags/2.4.1 protobuf

2. Get the protobuf-matlab source:
   git clone https://code.google.com/p/protobuf-matlab/

3. Add the protobuf-matlab src files to the Google Protobuf src:
   cp -r protobuf-matlab/src protobuf

4. Compile the modified protobuf project.

This should yield a protoc executable with a --matlab_out option. You can now
use protoc to generate Matlab reading and writing code for your .proto file(s).


Matlab support library setup
============================

In order to use the generated Matlab code, you'll need to add the protobuflib
directory to your Matlab path. protobuflib is a collection of .m utility files
used by the generated code.
